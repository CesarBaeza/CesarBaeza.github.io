	  <p> Is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp; Typically, a lens is used to focus the light reflected or emitted from objects into a real image on the light-sensitive surface inside a camera during a timed exposure. With an electronic image sensor, this produces an electrical charge at each pixel, which is electronically processed and stored in a digital image file for subsequent display or processing. The result with photographic emulsion is an invisible latent image, which is later chemically "developed" into a visible image, either negative or positive depending on the purpose of the photographic material and the method of processing. A negative image on film is traditionally used to photographically create a positive image on a paper base, known as a print, either by using an enlarger or by contact printing.</p>

	<p> Originally, all photography was monochrome, or black-and-white. Even after color film was readily available, black-and-white photography continued to dominate for decades, due to its lower cost and its "classic" photographic look. The tones and contrast between light and dark areas define black-and-white photography. It is important to note that monochromatic pictures are not necessarily composed of pure blacks, whites, and intermediate shades of gray but can involve shades of one particular hue depending on the process. The cyanotype process, for example, produces an image composed of blue tones. The albumen print process first used more than 170 years ago, produces brownish tones. </p>
	<p> Many photographers continue to produce some monochrome images, sometimes because of the established archival permanence of well processed silver halide based materials. Some full color digital images are processed using a variety of techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. Monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented as black and white or single color toned images they are found to be more effective. Although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. Almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard RGB color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <p>I love photography because you can do amazing things with it, is your own point pof view of the world, photos bring us creative and with it we can remember specially moments that someone happens in some place, in the park, traveling and other things.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Is amazing how you can make better your memories with a camera</strong></p>
<p> Opinion: Missing the moment and capturing it at the same time
  
  
  I see this sight with increasing frequency. </p>
<p> People holding up their phone in front of face recording a cool event or situation, like a concert or speech, watching the three-dimensional live event through a tiny screen. It’s a conscious decision – choosing to record the moment rather than experiencing the purity and reality of that moment. It’s a choice photographers know something about.
  
  It’s true, a photographer walks and balances on a thin line between the world we inhabit and the world we photograph. We’re usually not the active participants doing the things that people in our photographs are doing; and we’re not the passive audience watching them. It’s a unique space between the two worlds that I know well and I’m comfortable occupying. To do my thing I don’t need to be in the actual moment but need to concentrate and be in the “photographic moment”. It’s often a lonely pursuit. </p>
